### Description
This project analyzes the Cars24 dataset using SQL to understand car sales better. By looking at factors like selling price, fuel type, and mileage, we can help businesses make smarter decisions about pricing and inventory.

### Dataset Description / META DATA
The dataset contains the following columns:

1. **`name`**: The name or model of the car.
2. **`year`**: The manufacturing year of the car.
3. **`selling_price`**: The price at which the car was sold.
4. **`km_driven`**: The number of kilometers driven by the car.
5. **`fuel`**: The type of fuel the car uses.

11. **`max_power`**: The maximum power output of the car's engine.
12. **`seats`**: The number of seats in the car.

### Insights
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the Cars24 dataset, focusing on key metrics such as the total number of cars sold by each fuel type, average kilometers driven by each owner type. It also includes the average mileage by transmission type, the top 10 cars with the highest power output, and average kilometers driven by transmission type for cars.

### Main Findings
The analysis revealed that the average selling price of cars varies significantly depending on factors such as the model, year, and fuel type.
Certain car models emerged as top sellers, indicating strong demand among buyers.
Buyer preferences were influenced by factors such as fuel efficiency, transmission type, and seating capacity.
